# youtube_downloader_version2
  this script will allow you to download any Youtube video at the highest resolution up there by just pasting the URL , it uses pytube and ffmpeg to do so...
  this script will have more functionality added in the future , ex: downloading videos from a file that has many Youtube videos URLs...


  1) the first_version of the project : https://github.com/mbk-naboore/youtube_downloader
  2) this project is the better version of the previous one (a better) code and a cleaner one.
  
  
    1)**** for now the code is working perfectly (I have personality tried it havily for the past 15 hours)...
    2)**** the only thing that is a disadvantage is the comments (I did not have that much time to do all comments ,
           but I will update those in few days with some new features...
    3)**** there is a (test_urls.txt) file which is some high resolution short videos (8k, 4k, etc) 
           so you can try all the different functionalities the script has...
  
  3) the code was updated with some more functions and features such as having (the progress bar) function and the checker functions for the directories and user inputs.
