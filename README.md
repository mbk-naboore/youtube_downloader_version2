# youtube_downloader_version2
  this script will allow you to download any Youtube video at the highest resolution up there by just pasting the URL , it uses pytube and ffmpeg to do so...
  this script will have more functionality added in the future , ex: downloading videos from a file that has many Youtube videos URLs...


  1) the first_version of the project : https://github.com/mbk-naboore/youtube_downloader
  2) this project is the better version of the previous one (a better) code and a cleaner one.
  
  
  ****for now the code is working perfectly (I have personality tried it havily for the past 15 hours)...
  ****the only thing that is a disadvantage is the comments (I did not have that much time to do all comments , but I will update those in few days with some new features...
