# youtube_downloader_version2
  this script will allow you to download any Youtube video at the highest resolution up there by just pasting the URL , it uses pytube and ffmpeg to do so...
  this script will have more functionality added in the future , ex: downloading videos from a file that has many Youtube videos URLs...


  1) the first_version of the project : https://github.com/mbk-naboore/youtube_downloader
  
  
    1) for now the code is working perfectly (I have personality tried it havily for the past 15 hours)...
    2) the only thing that is a disadvantage is the comments (I did not have that much time to do all comments ,
           but I will update those in few days with some new features...
    3) there is a (test_urls.txt) file which is some high resolution short videos (8k, 4k, etc) 
           so you can try all the different functionalities the script has...
  
  
  
  ### I am working on this project daily ,the comments will be added with a perfect explanation... 
  ### for this version there is no commands like the CMD or Terminal but in the next version it will be a command based rather than choices...
